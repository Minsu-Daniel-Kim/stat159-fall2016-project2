## 2. Data

We download the data set `Credit` from online link `http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Credit.csv`, which is provided by the author of the book, "An Introduction to Statistical Learning". This data set records `Balance`, which is the average credit card debt for a number of individuals, as well as several predictors. The dataset has eleven variables - seven **quantitative** variables, `Income`, `Limit`, `Rating`, `Cards`, `Age`, `Education`, and `Balance`, and four **qualitative** variables, `Gender`, `Student`, `Married`, and `Ethnicity`. Our goal is to understand the relationship between `Balance` and these potential predictors with statistical fitting procedures.

### 2.1 Pre-modeling Data Processing

In order to fit the regression models, we first preprocess the dataset `Credit` with two steps:
* convert factors into dummy variables - which avoids the problem of input data as factors
* mean centering and standardization - which provides comparable scales for data analysis

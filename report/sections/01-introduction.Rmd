## 1. Introduction

Predictive Modeling Process aims to improve the results from fitting ordinary least squares in terms of **Prediction Accuracy** and **Model Interpretability**. According to the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning", alternative fitting procedures can yield better results:
* Prediction Accuracy: Provided that the true relationship between the response and the predictors is approximately linear, the least squares estimates will have low bias. If n ≫ p—that is, if n, the number of observations, is much larger than p, the number of variables—then the least squares estimates tend to also have low variance, and hence will perform well on test observations. However, if n is not much larger than p, then there can be a lot of variability in the least squares fit, resulting in overfitting and consequently poor predictions on future observations not used in model training. And if p > n, then there is no longer a unique least squares coefficient estimate: the variance is infinite so the method cannot be used at all. By constraining or shrinking the estimated coefficients, we can often substantially reduce the variance at the cost of a negligible increase in bias. This can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy with which we can predict the response for observations not used in model training.
* Model Interpretability: It is often the case that some or many of the variables used in a multiple regression model are in fact not associ- ated with the response. Including such irrelevant variables leads to unnecessary complexity in the resulting model. By removing these variables—that is, by setting the corresponding coefficient estimates to zero—we can obtain a model that is more easily interpreted. Now least squares is extremely unlikely to yield any coefficient estimates that are exactly zero. In this chapter, we see some approaches for au- tomatically performing feature selection or variable selection—that is, for excluding irrelevant variables from a multiple regression model.
